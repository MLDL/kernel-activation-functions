## Kernel activation functions (Keras)

In the *kafnets* module you can find the modules for defining KAF layers, both for feedforward networks and convolutional networks (using the flag 'conv' during initialization). 
The code has two demos to showcase the modules using the Keras Sequential model.

## Requirements

* keras = 2.2.4
* numpy = 1.15.4
