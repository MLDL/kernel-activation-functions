## Kernel activation functions (PyTorch)

In the *kafnets* module you can find the modules for defining KAF layers, both for feedforward networks and convolutional networks (using the flag 'conv' during initialization). 
The code has two demos to showcase the modules using the PyTorch sequential class.

## Requirements

* pytorch = 1.0.1
* numpy = 1.15.4
* tqdm (for demo_kaf_convolutional.py)
* scikit-learn 0.20.1 (for demo_feedforward.py)
